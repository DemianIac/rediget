# Rediget  
(An smart combination of Reddit an Deviget, you see?)

This is an example of application to read Reddit posts from the [top](https://www.reddit.com/top) chart.

### Some of the work done in this app

- Base project from a master/detail flow
- Create action to get posts from server
- Pagination
- Save and restore states
- Read and unread check
- Dismiss buttons
- Full screen of images (on browser) and save to gallery
- Pull to refresh
- Landscape support (fixed just to landscape and not to w600dp for tablets 
  to allow testing in a normal phone)
